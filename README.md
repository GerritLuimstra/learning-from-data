# Learning From Data

This repository contains the assignment files for the Learning From Data course taught at the University of Groningen in Semester 1A of the academic year 2022-2023. These assignments were worked on by [Sven Hofman](https://github.com/svenhofman), [Gerrit Luimstra](https://github.com/GerritLuimstra), and [Willard Verschoore](https://github.com/WillardVerschoore).

Assignment 1 can be found in the `assignment-1` directory and covers the use of classical models for the categorization of Amazon reviews.

Assignment 2 was an individual assignment and is thus not part of this shared repository.

Assignment 3 can be found in the `assignment-3` directory and covers the use of LSTMs and pretrained language models for the categorization of the same dataset of Amazon reviews.

The final project can be found in the `project` directory. The project concerns the task of offensive tweet classification. In it we use all techniques studied in previous assignments.
